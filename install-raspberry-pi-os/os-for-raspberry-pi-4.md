# OS for Raspberry Pi 4

I have very strange issue with my Raspberry Pi 4.&#x20;

Once I installed LibreELEC to use my Pie as a media player (to display a fireplace video on 4K TV). Intallation is a one-liner command on Linux, boot screen is beautiful with no kernel prints flickering on the screen, and yes, HDMI just works.

But when I install Raspberry OS, or Ubuntu, or Ubuntu Server then it displays first kernel prints then goes black, or it displays four pixels enlarged to the whole screen (looks like a spectrum or a rainbow) and nothing.&#x20;

I thought that I bricked my Pie somehow.&#x20;

But then I install LibreELEC and it works!

I rebooted Raspbian many times and once in a while it actually boots. That time I checked my IP address and configured SSH server. Then I disconnected HDMI cable and now it boots every time.

That is why, just in case, I have a list of different OSes that can be loaded to Raspberry Pi 4 sometimes just for test.

* Raspberry Pi OS (Raspbian) [https://www.raspberrypi.org/software/operating-systems/](https://www.raspberrypi.org/software/operating-systems/) (Raspbian with desktop requires > 4GB SD card, a real bummer)
* Ubuntu Mate
* Ubuntu Server [https://ubuntu.com/download/raspberry-pi](https://ubuntu.com/download/raspberry-pi)
* LibreELEC
* OSMC
* RISC OS
* Mozilla WebThings Gateway
* Ubuntu Core
* DietPi
* Lakka Linux
* RetroPie
* KaliLinux
* OpenMediaVault
* ROKOS
* Alpine Linux
* Kano OS
* KDE Plasma Bigscreen
* Manjaro Linux [https://manjaro.org/download/#raspberry-pi-4-xfce](https://manjaro.org/download/#raspberry-pi-4-xfce)
