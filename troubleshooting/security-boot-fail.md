# Security Boot Fail

![](<../.gitbook/assets/2021-08-03 12-39-11.JPG>)

This error usually means that you should disable Secure Boot.

It happens when grub tries to load something unsigned. Before you had two options: sign it and add certificates to NVRAM or use trickster bootloader from Kaspersy Lab. But nowadays only the former has left.
